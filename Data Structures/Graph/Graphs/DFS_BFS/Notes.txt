Degree of Separation - Find the degree of separation between two individuals in a social network 


DFS - A DFS marks all the vertices connected to a given source in time proportional to the sum of their degrees.
It traverses or searches a tree or graph. Explores as far possible along each branch before backtracking.(recursive, stack)

Connectivity - Given a graph, support queries of the form.  Are two given vertices connected? How many connected components does the graph have?

Single-Source Paths - Given a graph and a source vertex s, support queries of the form, Is there a path from s to a given target vertex v? If so, find such a path.
