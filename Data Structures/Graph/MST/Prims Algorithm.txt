Both Prim and Kruskalâ€™s algorithm solve the MST problem

Use Prim's algorithm when you have a graph with lots of edges.(Prim is Greedy)

For a graph with V vertices E edges, Kruskal's algorithm runs in O(E log V)????(E log E) time and Prim's algorithm can run in O(E + V log V) amortized time, if you use a Fibonacci Heap.

Prim's algorithm is significantly faster in the limit when you've got a really dense graph with many more edges than vertices. Kruskal performs better in typical situations (sparse graphs) because it uses simpler data structures.
