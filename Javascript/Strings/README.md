# Performance Testing 

Each file contains multiple functions that have algorithms
I will be testing and comparing each function and test
the length of time to complete for each. The final result
can be found in the file itself or its excel file.

E.g.
In the printReverse.js file there are three different functions

* usingFunctions
* looping
* usingLodash

Each of these function has a variation of how to reverse a string

# Excel

I tested out the running time for each function. All data is recorded
in each <name>.xlsx file.

Many of the test were ran 1000 or more times
