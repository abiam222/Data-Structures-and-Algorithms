# Performance Testing 

For every algorithm I will be testing each algorithm based
on their time (nanoseconds) compared to other algorithms.

E.g.
In the printReverse.js file there are three different functions

* usingFunctions
* looping
* usingLodash

Each of these function has a variation of how to reverse a string

# Excel

I tested out the running time for each function. All data is recorded
in each <name>.xlsx file.

Many of the test were ran 1000 or more times
